# Saving New Patents

First search the [USPTO Database](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html) which will list all patents and have them ordered correctly. Determine the new ones that need to be added to LinkedIn/resume. Note that if you search by name, the results will include both patents and patent applications - you want just the patents. 

Add any new ones to LinkedIn manually. 

Once you've determined the canonical list of new patents via the process above, go to [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/?sort=new) and find them there. The patent detail page on Google Patents imports nicely into Zotero. Go to the patent detail page for each one and use the Zotero connector to import into Zotero in the MyStuff/My Patents folder. 

When you're done importing into Zotero, select all items in the My Stuff/My Patents folder, right click, and choose Export Items. Select "Better BibLaTeX" as the export format. Save the output as `patents.bib` and copy to `~/code/resume/src` or wherever the resume repo lives. Verify the diff looks correct.
