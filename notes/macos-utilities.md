# MacOS Utilities:

* [Contexts](https://contexts.co/): Smart window switcher
  * Also tried [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) but found it to be slow and harder to use.
* [Shortcut Detective](https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/labs/): Determine which app receives a given keyboard shortcut
* [Script Debugger](https://latenightsw.com/): A better tool for editing AppleScripts than the built-in script editor (includes debugging support)
* [OpenIn](https://loshadki.app/openin4/): Utility that supports opening links in a specific browser
