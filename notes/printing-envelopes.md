# Printing Envelops

From [HP Documentation](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04800080):
* Load envelopes in Tray 1 (door on front of printer) face up, with the short, postage end leading into the printer.
* Use [EnvelopeMagic](https://www.envelopemagic.com/) MacOS app to enter addresses and print (no need to mess with printer configuration)
