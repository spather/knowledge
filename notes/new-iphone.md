# Things to do when setting up a new iPhone

Transfer data directly from the old phone vs restoring an iCloud backup. This will leave most app state (like logins) intact vs the iCloud restore which requires re-logging in to every app. 

Migrate Apple watch to new phone.

Migrate 2fac Authenticator apps:
* Google Authenticator: can export accounts and import them on new phone
* Microsoft Authenticator: log in and it will restore from cloud backup

Go through Bluetooth paired devices on old phone:
* Forget device on old phone
* Pair on new phone

Audible
* Log in and re-download any books currently listening to

Log into all Google accounts (only one account seems to make it over on the migration)

Fantastical
* Enter account key from old device

Strong app
* Restore purchases
* Restore connection to Apple Health
* Restore connection to Apple Watch

WhatsApp
* Re-login with phone number
